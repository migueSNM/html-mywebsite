            Simply, Tennis Prime’s goal is to work with children and kids from 7
            – 16 that want to train, play in tournaments, and experience a fun
            and supportive community. I want to make it simple for everyone
            involved. We have transportation, meals, world class training
            facilities, and top coaches that develop the children and when ready
            (or by skill level) we enter kids into tournaments. This site gives
            details about our training, camps, and tournaments – please review
            and we look forward to having you and your child involved. Please
            email me and reach out anytime to discuss the program and your
            child.
